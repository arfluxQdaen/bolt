## What Causes Artisteer Error Code 302?
 
The most common cause of this error is a firewall or antivirus program that blocks Artisteer from connecting to the internet. Artisteer needs to access a server at http://54.218.66.112/ to export your project. If your firewall or antivirus program prevents this connection, you will get the error code 302.
 
Another possible cause of this error is a custom PHP code that you have added to your template. Artisteer may not be able to process this code and export your project correctly.
 
## How to Fix Artisteer Error Code 302?
 
There are two main solutions to fix this error:
 
1. Allow Artisteer to connect to the internet through your firewall or antivirus program. You can do this by adding Artisteer as an exception or trusted program in your firewall or antivirus settings. Alternatively, you can temporarily disable your firewall or antivirus program while exporting your project, but make sure to enable it again afterwards.
2. Remove any custom PHP code that you have added to your template. You can do this by editing your template file in a text editor and deleting the code that causes the problem. For example, some users have reported that the error was caused by a custom PHP code in the footer section of their template.

If you follow these steps, you should be able to export your project without any errors. If you still have problems, you can contact Artisteer support at http://www.artisteer.com/?p=support for further assistance.
