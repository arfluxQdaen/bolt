Championship Manager 01/02 is a classic football management game that was released in 2001. It is still popular among fans who enjoy the retro style and the challenge of managing teams from different leagues and countries. However, if you want to play the game on your modern PC, you may encounter some problems with the CD protection. The game requires you to insert the original CD every time you launch it, which can be inconvenient and risky for your disc. Fortunately, there are some ways to bypass the CD check and play the game without CD.

One of the easiest methods is to download a No-CD patch or a fixed executable file that will replace the original game files and remove the CD requirement. You can find these files on various websites that offer game fixes and trainers, such as GameCopyWorld[^1^], MegaGames[^3^], or My Abandonware[^2^]. Make sure you download the file that matches your game version and language. You can check your game version by looking at the bottom right corner of the main menu screen. The latest official patch for the game is v3.9.68, which you can download from CM 01/02 Forum[^2^].
 
After you download the No-CD patch or fixed executable file, you need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. Then, you need to copy and paste it into your game directory, where you installed the game. You may need to overwrite the existing files, so make sure you backup them first in case something goes wrong. Once you do that, you can run the game without CD and enjoy managing your favorite team.
 
Another method is to use a No-CD loader or a virtual drive program that will trick the game into thinking that you have inserted the CD. A No-CD loader is a small program that you run before launching the game, and it will bypass the CD check. A virtual drive program is a software that creates a virtual CD-ROM drive on your computer, where you can mount an image file of the game disc. You can find these programs on the same websites that offer game fixes and trainers, such as GameCopyWorld[^1^], MegaGames[^3^], or My Abandonware[^2^]. Make sure you download the program that matches your game version and language.
 
After you download the No-CD loader or virtual drive program, you need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. Then, you need to copy and paste it into your game directory, where you installed the game. If you are using a No-CD loader, you need to run it before launching the game. If you are using a virtual drive program, you need to mount an image file of the game disc on your virtual drive before launching the game. You can find image files of the game disc on various websites that offer old games for download, such as My Abandonware[^2^]. Once you do that, you can run the game without CD and enjoy managing your favorite team.
 
Championship Manager 01/02 is a timeless game that deserves to be played by football fans of all ages. With these methods, you can play the game without CD and avoid any hassle or damage to your disc. Have fun and good luck!
