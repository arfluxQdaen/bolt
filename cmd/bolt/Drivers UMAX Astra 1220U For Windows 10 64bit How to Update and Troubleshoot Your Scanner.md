In this article, we will show you two methods to install UMAX Astra 1220U scanner drivers on Windows 10 64-bit. The first method involves using a third-party software called VueScan, which is a scanning application that supports many scanners, including the UMAX Astra 1220U. The second method involves using a modified driver file that was created by a user on the internet. Both methods require some technical skills and may not work for everyone, so please proceed with caution and at your own risk.
 
## Method 1: Using VueScan
 
VueScan is a popular scanning software that can work with many scanners that are not supported by Windows 10. It has a free trial version that you can download from [its official website](https://www.hamrick.com/). To use VueScan with your UMAX Astra 1220U scanner, follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install VueScan on your PC.
2. Connect your UMAX Astra 1220U scanner to your PC via USB.
3. Launch VueScan and select UMAX Astra 1220U from the Scanner menu.
4. Adjust the scanning settings as you wish and click Scan.
5. Save the scanned image to your desired location.

Note that the free trial version of VueScan will add a watermark to your scanned images. To remove the watermark, you need to purchase a license for VueScan, which costs $39.95 for the Standard Edition or $89.95 for the Professional Edition.
 
## Method 2: Using Modified Driver File
 
Another way to install UMAX Astra 1220U scanner drivers on Windows 10 64-bit is to use a modified driver file that was created by a user named [Easy Professor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz7kZw8fQv7VZ6xQyJb4Y9g). He uploaded a video tutorial on YouTube showing how he got his UMAX Astra 1220U scanner working on Windows 10 using this driver file. You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jSW8524IyU). To use this method, follow these steps:

1. Download the modified driver file from [this link](https://jovial-jackson-925656.netlify.app/drivers-umax-astra-1220u-for-windows-10-64bit).
2. Extract the zip file to a folder on your PC.
3. Connect your UMAX Astra 1220U scanner to your PC via USB.
4. Open Device Manager and find your scanner under Imaging Devices or Other Devices.
5. Right-click on your scanner and select Update Driver Software.
6. Select Browse my computer for driver software and navigate to the folder where you extracted the driver file.
7. Click Next and follow the instructions to install the driver.
8. Restart your PC and test your scanner using any scanning software of your choice.

Note that this method may not work for everyone, and it may cause some compatibility issues or errors on your PC. Use it at your own risk and make sure you have a backup of your important data before proceeding.
