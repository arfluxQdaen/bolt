Dual Family is a game that has been in development since 2017 by Gumdrop Games, an independent studio that focuses on creating adult fiction visual novels. The game has been released in episodic format, with each part adding more content and scenes to the story. The game is currently available on Steam, where it has received mostly positive reviews from players who appreciate the quality of the graphics, the depth of the characters, and the variety of the choices.
  
The game is not for everyone, however, as it deals with themes of incest, adultery, and manipulation. The game also contains explicit sexual content that may not be suitable for some audiences. The game is marked as 'Adult Only' on Steam and requires age verification to access. The game also has a Patreon page where supporters can get early access to new updates, exclusive previews, and bonus content.
  
If you are looking for a game that offers a compelling and immersive story with multiple endings, a game that challenges you to make difficult and moral choices that affect your family members, a game that features realistic and detailed 3D graphics and animations, and a game that explores the dark and taboo side of human sexuality, then Dual Family may be the game for you.
