# Electromagnetic Wave Theory by Jin Au Kong: A Comprehensive Textbook for Students and Researchers
  
Electromagnetic wave theory is a branch of physics that studies the properties and applications of electromagnetic waves, such as light, radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Electromagnetic waves are oscillating electric and magnetic fields that propagate through space and interact with matter.
  
One of the most authoritative and comprehensive textbooks on electromagnetic wave theory is *Electromagnetic Wave Theory* by Jin Au Kong, a professor of electrical engineering at MIT. This book covers topics essential to the understanding of electromagnetic waves, such as fundamental laws and equations, transmission line theory, waveguides, antennas, scattering, diffraction, dispersion, polarization, nonlinear optics, and metamaterials.

In this section, we will briefly introduce some of the main topics covered in *Electromagnetic Wave Theory* by Jin Au Kong.
  
## Fundamental Laws and Equations
  
The foundation of electromagnetic wave theory is based on four fundamental laws that describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields in different situations. These laws are known as Maxwell's equations, named after the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell who formulated them in the 19th century. Maxwell's equations can be written in two forms: differential and integral. The differential form expresses the relation between the electric and magnetic fields and their sources (charges and currents) at a point in space, while the integral form expresses the relation between the electric and magnetic fluxes and their sources over a closed surface or a loop.
  
Maxwell's equations can be derived from more basic principles, such as conservation of charge and energy, or from variational principles, such as Hamilton's principle or Lagrange's equations. Maxwell's equations can also be generalized to include relativistic effects, such as Lorentz transformations and four-vectors.
  
## Transmission Line Theory
  
A transmission line is a device that carries electromagnetic waves from one point to another with minimal loss or distortion. Transmission lines are widely used in communication systems, such as telephones, radios, TVs, and computers. Transmission lines can be classified into two types: guided and unguided. Guided transmission lines are those that confine the electromagnetic waves within a physical structure, such as wires, cables, coaxial lines, waveguides, or optical fibers. Unguided transmission lines are those that allow the electromagnetic waves to propagate freely in space, such as antennas or free-space links.
  
Transmission line theory is the study of how electromagnetic waves propagate along transmission lines and how they interact with different elements, such as sources, loads, terminations, junctions, bends, discontinuities, or impedances. Transmission line theory involves concepts such as voltage and current waves, reflection and transmission coefficients, standing wave ratio (SWR), impedance matching, Smith chart, scattering parameters (S-parameters), and transmission line equations.
  
## Waveguides
  
A waveguide is a special type of guided transmission line that supports only certain modes of electromagnetic waves. A mode is a specific pattern of electric and magnetic fields that satisfies the boundary conditions of the waveguide. A waveguide can be characterized by its geometry (shape and size), material (dielectric or metallic), and frequency range (cut-off frequency and bandwidth).
  
Waveguides are commonly used to transmit high-frequency electromagnetic waves, such as microwaves or optical waves. Waveguides can have various shapes, such as rectangular, circular, elliptical, or irregular. Waveguides can also be classified into two types: uniform and nonuniform. Uniform waveguides have constant cross-sections along their length, while nonuniform waveguides have varying cross-sections due to bends, tapers, steps, or discontinuities.
  
Waveguide theory is the study of how electromagnetic waves propagate along waveguides and how they interact with different elements, such as sources, loads, terminations, junctions, bends, tapers, steps, discontinuities, or impedances. Waveguide theory involves concepts such as mode number, mode shape, mode polarization, mode propagation constant, mode cut-off frequency, mode bandwidth, mode dispersion, mode coupling, mode conversion, and mode excitation.
