- Hardware ID - 32-bit globally-unique identifier that can be used to lock the software to a specific dongle.
- Software ID - 32-bit user-defined identifier that can be used to differentiate different software products or versions.
- Basic and Advanced Password - Two levels of password protection that can be used to authenticate the dongle and the software.
- Licensing Modules - 64 modules that can be used to store license information, such as expiration date, usage limit, or feature control.
- User-Defined Algorithms - 80 algorithms that can be used to encrypt or decrypt data using the dongle's internal memory and CPU.
- Memory Capacity - 1KB of user space that can be used to store custom data or code.
- Time License - A feature that allows the dongle to generate a time-based license based on the system clock or an internal RTC (real-time clock).
- DES, 3DES, RSA Encryption - Standard encryption algorithms that can be used to enhance the security of the dongle and the software.

Feitian Rockey4 USB dongle is designed to prevent software piracy and unauthorized use, but sometimes it may be necessary to emulate it for backup, testing, or development purposes. Emulating a Feitian Rockey4 USB dongle means creating a virtual device that mimics the behavior and functionality of the original dongle. This way, the software can run without requiring the physical presence of the dongle.
 
There are different methods and tools to emulate a Feitian Rockey4 USB dongle, depending on the type and complexity of the software protection. Some of them are:

- Dongle Dumpers - These are programs that can read and save the data from the dongle's memory and CPU. They can be used to create a backup file of the dongle's content, which can then be loaded into a virtual device or an emulator. Some examples of dongle dumpers are USBTrace, HDD Raw Copy Tool, or Dumper.exe.
- Dongle Emulators - These are programs that can create a virtual device that acts as a Feitian Rockey4 USB dongle. They can load the backup file created by a dongle dumper and simulate the communication between the dongle and the software. Some examples of dongle emulators are MultiKey, Sentinel Emulator, or Emulator.exe.
- Dongle Cloners - These are devices that can copy the data from one Feitian Rockey4 USB dongle to another. They can be used to create a duplicate dongle that has the same features and functionality as the original one. Some examples of dongle cloners are Feitian Cloner, Clone Dongle Tool, or Cloner.exe.

To emulate a Feitian Rockey4 USB dongle, you need to follow these steps:

1. Connect the original Feitian Rockey4 USB dongle to your computer.
2. Run a dongle dumper program and select the Feitian Rockey4 USB device from the list.
3. Start the dumping process and wait until it finishes. Save the backup file in a safe location.
4. Disconnect the original Feitian Rockey4 USB dongle from your computer.
5. Run a dongle emulator program and select the backup file from your location.
6. Create a virtual device and assign it a free USB port.
7. Start the emulation process and wait until it finishes. The virtual device should appear in your device manager as a Feitian Rockey4 USB device.
8. Run your software and enjoy it without requiring the original Feitian Rockey4 USB dongle.

Note: Emulating a Feitian Rockey4 USB dongle may violate the terms and conditions of your software license agreement. Please use this method only for legitimate purposes and at your own risk. We are not responsible for any damage or loss caused by using this method.
