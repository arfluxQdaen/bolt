A third highlight of the film is its humor. The film adds some comedic elements to lighten up the mood and make the story more enjoyable. For example, there are some funny scenes involving Malin Kundang's pet monkey, who often causes trouble and mischief. There are also some jokes and references to modern culture and trends, such as social media, online shopping, and memes. The humor helps to balance the seriousness and sadness of the story, and makes it more appealing to younger audiences.
 
## The Drawbacks
 
One of the drawbacks of the film is its length. The film runs for about 90 minutes, which is relatively short for an animated feature. Some viewers may feel that the film is too rushed or incomplete, especially in terms of character development and plot progression. Some scenes may seem too brief or abrupt, leaving some questions unanswered or some emotions unexplored. For example, some viewers may want to know more about Malin Kundang's life before he left his mother, or his relationship with his wife and friends.
 
Another drawback of the film is its lack of originality. The film follows the original story very closely, without adding much innovation or creativity. Some viewers may find the film predictable or boring, as they already know what will happen next. Some viewers may also prefer a different interpretation or adaptation of the story, such as a modern or futuristic setting, a different genre or style, or a different ending or twist.
 
A third drawback of the film is its moral message. The film portrays Malin Kundang as a selfish and ungrateful son who deserves to be punished for his actions. Some viewers may find this message too harsh or simplistic, as it does not consider the complexity and diversity of human nature and behavior. Some viewers may also disagree with the idea of karma or divine justice, as they believe that people have free will and can change their fate.
 
## The Comparison
 
The film Malin Kundang Kartun 11 is not the first adaptation of the story. There have been several other versions of the story in different media, such as books, comics, movies, and cartoons. Some of these adaptations are:
 
- Malin Kundang: A book by Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, published in 1951. This book is considered one of the classic works of Indonesian literature, as it explores the themes of identity, culture, and nationalism.
