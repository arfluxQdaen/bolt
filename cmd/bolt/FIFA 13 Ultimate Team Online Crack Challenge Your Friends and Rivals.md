## Step 1: Download and Install Topaz ReMask 3
 
The first step is to download and install Topaz ReMask 3 on your computer. You can get the latest version of Topaz ReMask 3 from the official website[^1^] [^2^]. You can also download a free trial version to test the software before buying it.
 
Topaz ReMask 3 is compatible with Windows and Mac OS X operating systems. It also works as a standalone application or as a plugin for Photoshop, Lightroom, and other photo editing software. To install Topaz ReMask 3, follow the instructions on the website or the setup wizard.
  
## Step 2: Open Your Image and Create a Tri-Map
 
The next step is to open your image and create a tri-map. A tri-map is a color-coded map that tells Topaz ReMask 3 what parts of the image you want to keep (green), cut (red), or compute (blue).
 
To open your image, you can either drag and drop it into the Topaz ReMask 3 interface or use the File menu. Once your image is loaded, you will see a toolbar on the left side with various tools and options. To create a tri-map, you can use the following tools:

- The \*\*Brush\*\* tool allows you to paint green or red over the areas you want to keep or cut. You can adjust the size, hardness, and opacity of the brush using the sliders on the right side.
- The \*\*Bucket\*\* tool allows you to fill large areas with green or red. You can also use the \*\*Magic Wand\*\* tool to select similar colors and fill them with green or red.
- The \*\*Compute\*\* tool allows you to draw a blue line around the edges of your subject. This tells Topaz ReMask 3 to compute the mask based on the contrast between the subject and the background.

You don't have to be very precise when creating a tri-map. Just make sure that you cover most of your subject with green, most of your background with red, and draw a blue line around the edges of your subject. You can also use the \*\*Eraser\*\* tool to correct any mistakes.

## Step 3: Compute and Refine Your Mask
 
The third step is to compute and refine your mask. Once you have created a tri-map, click on the \*\*Compute Mask\*\* button on the bottom right corner. This will start the masking process and show you a preview of your mask on the right side.
 
You can switch between different views using the buttons on the top right corner. You can also zoom in and out using the mouse wheel or the slider on the bottom left corner. To refine your mask, you can use the following tools:

- The \*\*Edge Shift\*\* slider allows you to shift the mask edge in either direction. This can help you adjust for soft or hard edges.
- The \*\*Foreground Recovery\*\* slider allows you to revive the color of your foreground in weaker or more transparent areas. This can be useful for fur, whiskers, or wispy hair.
- The \*\*Defringe\*\* slider allows you to desaturate the edges of your mask to help with color contamination and bleeding.
- The \*\*Color Range\*\* 8cf37b1e13
