Fortunately, you don't have to spend a fortune to enjoy flying over Dubai in your flight simulator. There are many free add-ons available online that can enhance the default scenery of FSX (Microsoft Flight Simulator X) with more detailed and accurate representations of Dubai's landmarks and airports. In this article, we will show you how to download and install free Dubai scenery for FSX in a few easy steps.
 
## Step 1: Find a Free Dubai Scenery Add-on
 
The first step is to find a free Dubai scenery add-on that suits your preferences and system requirements. There are many websites that offer free downloads of FSX add-ons, such as [Fly Away Simulation](https://flyawaysimulation.com/downloads/98/fsx-scenery/), [FlightSim.com](https://www.flightsim.com/vbfs/fslib.php?searchid=80894467), and [Simviation](https://www.simviation.com/1/browse-Scenery-63-0). You can browse through their categories or use their search functions to find what you are looking for.
 
For example, if you type "Dubai" in the search box of Fly Away Simulation, you will get a list of results that include various Dubai scenery add-ons, such as [Dubai International Airport Scenery](https://flyawaysimulation.com/downloads/files/2473/fsx-dubai-international-airport-scenery/), [Dubai City Scenery](https://flyawaysimulation.com/downloads/files/2474/fsx-dubai-city-scenery/), and [Dubai World Islands Scenery](https://flyawaysimulation.com/downloads/files/2475/fsx-dubai-world-islands-scenery/). You can click on each result to see more details, screenshots, ratings, and comments from other users.
 
When choosing a free Dubai scenery add-on, make sure to check the following information:
 
- The compatibility with your version of FSX (Standard, Deluxe, or Steam Edition).
- The file size and the download speed of the add-on.
- The installation instructions and the required software or tools (such as WinZip or WinRAR).
- The performance impact and the recommended settings of the add-on.
- The feedback and reviews from other users.

Once you have found a free Dubai scenery add-on that meets your criteria, you can download it by clicking on the download button or link provided by the website. You might need to register an account or complete a captcha verification before downloading.
 
## Step 2: Extract and Copy the Add-on Files
 
The next step is to extract and copy the add-on files to the correct folder in your FSX directory. Most free Dubai scenery add-ons come in compressed ZIP or RAR files that contain one or more folders with names like "Scenery" or "Texture". You will need to use a software like WinZip or WinRAR to extract these files from the compressed file.
 
After extracting the files, you will need to copy them to the "Addon Scenery" folder in your FSX directory. The default location of this folder is C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\Addon Scenery. If you have installed FSX in a different location, you will need to find it accordingly.
