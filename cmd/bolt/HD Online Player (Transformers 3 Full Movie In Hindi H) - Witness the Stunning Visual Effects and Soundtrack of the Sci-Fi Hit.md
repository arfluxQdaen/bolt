Transformers 3, also known as Transformers: Dark of the Moon, is the third installment of the popular sci-fi action franchise based on the Hasbro toys. The film, directed by Michael Bay and starring Shia LaBeouf, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, and John Turturro, was released in 2011 in 2D, 3D, and IMAX 3D formats. The film was dubbed in Hindi for the Indian audience and was available to watch online on various platforms.
 
The plot of the film revolves around a secret that has been hidden on the dark side of the moon since the 1960s. A mysterious event from Earth's past threatens to ignite a war of such magnitude that the Transformers alone cannot save the planet. Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) and his new girlfriend Carly (Huntington-Whiteley) get involved in the conflict as they try to help Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) and his Autobots stop the Decepticons from using a powerful device called the Pillar to enslave humanity.

The film is a visual spectacle with stunning special effects, explosive action sequences, and impressive 3D technology. The film also features some iconic scenes such as the destruction of Chicago, the wing-suit jump from a skyscraper, and the epic showdown between Optimus Prime and Sentinel Prime (voiced by Leonard Nimoy). The film also pays homage to some classic sci-fi films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Terminator, and Star Trek.
 
However, the film is not without its flaws. The film suffers from a weak script, poor character development, excessive runtime, and offensive humor. The film also has some plot holes, inconsistencies, and logical errors that may confuse or annoy some viewers. The film also received criticism for its portrayal of women, minorities, and foreign cultures.

Overall, Transformers 3 is a mindless but entertaining popcorn flick that delivers on its promise of action and spectacle. The film is best enjoyed by fans of the franchise and those who are looking for a fun and thrilling ride. The film is not recommended for those who are looking for a deep and meaningful story or those who are easily offended by crude jokes and stereotypes.
 
The film is rated PG-13 for intense prolonged sequences of sci-fi action violence, mayhem and destruction, and for language, some sexuality and innuendo.
  
The film also features some notable performances from the cast. Shia LaBeouf delivers a convincing and charismatic performance as the reluctant hero Sam Witwicky, who struggles to find his place in the world after saving it twice. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who replaced Megan Fox as the female lead, does a decent job as the supportive and loyal Carly, who stands by Sam despite the dangers and challenges they face. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson reprise their roles as the military allies of the Autobots, who provide some comic relief and action support. John Turturro returns as the eccentric former agent Simmons, who adds some humor and intrigue to the plot. The film also features some cameo appearances from celebrities such as Patrick Dempsey, Frances McDormand, John Malkovich, Ken Jeong, and Buzz Aldrin.
 
The film also boasts of a spectacular soundtrack composed by Steve Jablonsky, who has worked on all the Transformers films. The soundtrack features some memorable themes and motifs that enhance the mood and emotion of the scenes. The soundtrack also includes some songs from popular artists such as Linkin Park, Paramore, My Chemical Romance, Skillet, and Goo Goo Dolls. The film also uses some classic songs from Pink Floyd, The Beatles, and Elvis Presley to create some contrast and irony.
 
The film also has some interesting trivia and facts that may interest some viewers. The film was shot in various locations around the world such as Chicago, Detroit, Washington D.C., Florida, Moscow, Chernobyl, and Jordan. The film also used some real-life military equipment and personnel such as F-22 Raptors, A-10 Thunderbolts, Ospreys, Chinooks, AC-130 Spectres, SEALs, Rangers, and NEST teams. The film also had some technical challenges such as converting the 2D footage to 3D in post-production and creating realistic CGI models of the Transformers. The film also had some controversies such as the removal of Megan Fox from the cast, the use of Nazi imagery in one scene, and the alleged plagiarism of some scenes from other films.
