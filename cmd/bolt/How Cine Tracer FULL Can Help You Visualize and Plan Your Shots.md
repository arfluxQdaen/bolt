Cine Tracer FULL is currently available on Steam as an Early Access game, which means you can get instant access and start playing while the game is still in development. You can also give feedback and suggestions to the developer through various channels, such as Twitch, Discord, and Facebook. The Early Access version has the basic cameras, lighting, and talent systems in place with one medium-sized map to explore and build in. More maps and features are coming soon!
 
One of the main advantages of Cine Tracer FULL is that it uses real-time ray tracing technology to render realistic lighting and shadows that mimic the real world. This means you can see how light behaves and affects the mood and emotion of your scene as you adjust it. You can also choose from a range of real-world based cameras and lenses that have accurate parameters and limitations. You can then position your camera using various tools such as tripods, dollies, cranes, etc. and take pictures that go to a storyboard.
 
Cine Tracer FULL is not only a useful tool for previsualization and planning, but also a fun and creative way to experiment with different shots and lighting setups without spending money or time on a real set. You can also learn from other filmmakers who share their work and tutorials on the Cine Tracer community hub. Whether you are a professional cinematographer, a film student, or a hobbyist, Cine Tracer FULL can help you improve your skills and unleash your imagination.
  
But don't just take our word for it. Cine Tracer FULL has received mostly positive reviews from users on Steam, who praise its realism, ease of use, and potential for learning and creativity. Here are some of the comments from satisfied customers:
 
- "This is an amazing tool for filmmakers. It's like having a virtual film set where you can experiment with different shots and lighting without any limitations. It's also very fun to play with and see your ideas come to life."
- "Cine Tracer is a game changer for me. I use it to previsualize my projects and to test different scenarios and angles. It saves me a lot of time and money on set and helps me communicate better with my crew and clients."
- "I love this game. It's like a sandbox for cinematography. You can create any scene you want and try different cameras, lenses, lights, etc. It's very realistic and accurate, and it teaches you a lot about how to shoot a film."

If you are interested in trying Cine Tracer FULL for yourself, you can buy it on Steam for $89.99. You will need a Windows PC with a decent graphics card that supports ray tracing, such as an NVIDIA RTX series. You can also follow the development of the game on Twitch, Discord, and Facebook, where you can interact with the developer and other users. Cine Tracer FULL is constantly being updated and improved, so you can expect more features and content in the future.
 
Cine Tracer FULL is more than just a game. It's a powerful tool for filmmakers who want to plan and visualize their shots in a realistic and immersive way.
