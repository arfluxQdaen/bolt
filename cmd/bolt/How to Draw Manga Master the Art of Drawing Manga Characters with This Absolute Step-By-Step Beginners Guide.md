The first step is to decide what kind of manga character you want to draw. There are many genres and subgenres of manga, such as shonen (action-adventure), shojo (romance), seinen (mature), josei (women's), horror, comedy, fantasy, sci-fi, and more. Each genre has its own conventions and tropes, so you should do some research and find some examples of manga that you like and inspire you.
 
The second step is to sketch the basic shape and proportions of your manga character. You can use a simple stick figure or a geometric shape to represent the body. The head is usually about one-sixth of the total height of the character, and the eyes are about halfway down the face. The shoulders are about two heads wide, and the waist is about one head wide. The arms and legs are about the same length as the torso. You can adjust these proportions depending on the age, gender, and style of your character.

The third step is to add details and features to your manga character. You can start by drawing the eyes, which are one of the most important and expressive parts of a manga character. The eyes are usually oval or almond-shaped, with thick eyelashes and eyebrows. The iris is usually large and colorful, with a highlight or a reflection to make it shiny. The nose and mouth are usually small and simple, with a curved line or a dot for the nose and a line or a curve for the mouth. You can also add some details like freckles, scars, or piercings.
 
The fourth step is to draw the hair and clothing of your manga character. The hair is usually one of the most distinctive and creative aspects of a manga character. You can draw it in any style, length, color, or texture that you want. You can also add accessories like hats, ribbons, or clips. The clothing should match the genre and personality of your character. You can draw it in any fashion or style that you want, but make sure to add some folds and wrinkles to make it realistic and dynamic.
 
The fifth step is to ink and color your manga character. You can use a pen, a marker, or a digital tool to trace over your sketch and make it clean and crisp. You can also erase any unwanted lines or mistakes. You can use any colors that you want for your manga character, but make sure to use some shading and highlights to make it more three-dimensional and realistic. You can also add some backgrounds or effects to make your manga character more interesting and appealing.
 
Congratulations! You have just learned how to draw manga: the absolute step-by-step beginners guide on drawing manga characters (mastering). Now you can practice your skills and create your own manga characters with confidence and creativity.
