However, some players may have encountered a problem with the audio language of the game. If you have bought the game from a Russian website or downloaded a Russian version of the game, you may have noticed that the audio is in Russian and there is no option to change it in the game settings. This can be frustrating if you do not understand Russian and want to enjoy the game's story and dialogue.
 
Fortunately, there is a way to fix this issue and change the audio language of Just Cause 2 from Russian to English. You will need to modify some files in the game's folder and replace them with the English ones. Here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. Go to the folder where you installed Just Cause 2. It should be something like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Just Cause 2`.
2. Open the `sound` folder and then the `fmod` folder.
3. Find the two files that correspond to your language. They should have a suffix like `_fre` for French, `_ger` for German, or `_rus` for Russian.
4. Rename these two files by adding `_backup` at the end. For example, if you have `Dialog_PA_rus.fsb` and `Dialog_Mission Specific_rus.fsb`, rename them to `Dialog_PA_rus_backup.fsb` and `Dialog_Mission Specific_rus_backup.fsb`. This will create a backup of your original files in case you want to switch back later.
5. Find the two files that correspond to English. They should have a suffix like `_eng`.
6. Rename these two files by removing `_eng` and adding the suffix of your language. For example, if you have `Dialog_PA_eng.fsb` and `Dialog_Mission Specific_eng.fsb`, rename them to `Dialog_PA_rus.fsb` and `Dialog_Mission Specific_rus.fsb`. This will make the game load the English files instead of the Russian ones.
7. Close the folder and launch the game. You should now hear the audio in English.
8. If you want to activate subtitles, you can do so in the game options.

This method was suggested by a user named John on Steam Community[^3^]. It should work for any language that has a corresponding file in the game's folder. However, if you encounter any problems or errors, you can always restore your backup files by renaming them back to their original names.

Just Cause 2 is not the only game that has a language issue. Many games that are sold or downloaded from different regions may have different audio or text languages that do not match the player's preference. This can be due to various reasons, such as licensing, localization, or censorship.
 
Some games may have an option to change the language in the game settings or on the launcher. However, some games may not have this option or may require additional steps to change the language. For example, some games may require editing a configuration file, downloading a language pack, or using a third-party tool.
 
If you are facing a similar problem with another game, you can try searching online for a solution. There may be guides, forums, or videos that can help you change the language of your game. However, be careful when downloading or modifying any files from unknown sources, as they may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer.
 
Alternatively, you can also contact the game's developer or publisher and ask them for assistance. They may be able to provide you with an official patch or update that can fix the language issue. However, this may depend on their availability and willingness to support your region.
