# Mirrors Edge Update 1.01-Reloaded: A Review by Zygorius(Neo)
 
Mirrors Edge is a first-person action-adventure game that puts you in the shoes of Faith, a runner who delivers messages across a dystopian city while avoiding the authorities. The game was released in 2008 and received critical acclaim for its innovative gameplay, visuals and soundtrack.
 
However, some players complained about the game's bugs, glitches and performance issues. To address these problems, the developers released an update patch (version 1.01) that fixed some of the most common errors and improved the game's stability and compatibility.

But was this update enough to make Mirrors Edge a flawless experience? To find out, we asked Zygorius(Neo), a computer gamer and blogger who has played and reviewed the game before and after the patch. Here is what he had to say:

> "Mirrors Edge is one of my favorite games of all time. I love the feeling of freedom and adrenaline that comes from running, jumping and sliding across the rooftops of the city. The game's graphics are stunning and the music is amazing. The story is also engaging and well-written, with a strong female protagonist who is not afraid to fight for what she believes in.

> However, I have to admit that the game had some flaws when it first came out. I encountered several bugs and glitches that sometimes ruined my immersion or made me restart a level. For example, sometimes Faith would get stuck in mid-air or fall through the floor. Other times, the game would crash or freeze without warning. The game also had some compatibility issues with some graphics cards and operating systems.
> 
> 
> That's why I was happy when I heard that the developers released an update patch that promised to fix these problems. I downloaded and installed the patch (version 1.01-reloaded) and hoped for the best.
> 
> 
> And I have to say that I was not disappointed. The patch did improve the game's performance and stability significantly. I noticed that the game ran smoother and faster, with less lag and stuttering. The bugs and glitches were also reduced or eliminated. The game did not crash or freeze anymore, and it worked well with my graphics card and Windows 10.
> 
> 
> The patch also added some new features and options that enhanced the game's replay value and customization. For example, it added a time trial mode that allowed me to compete with other players online for the best scores on each level. It also added a difficulty slider that let me adjust the game's challenge level according to my preference. It also added some new skins and outfits for Faith that I could unlock by completing certain achievements.
> 
> 
> Overall, I think that the patch (version 1.01-reloaded) made Mirrors Edge a much better game than it was before. It fixed most of the issues that plagued the original release and added some new content that made the game more fun and varied. I would recommend this patch to anyone who owns or plans to buy Mirrors Edge for their computer. It will make your gaming experience more enjoyable and satisfying."
