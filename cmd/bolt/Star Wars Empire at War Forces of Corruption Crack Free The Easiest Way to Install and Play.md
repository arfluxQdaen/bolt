# Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption - A Review
 
Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption is an expansion pack for the real-time strategy game Star Wars: Empire at War, released in October 2006. It adds a third faction, the Zann Consortium, a criminal organization led by Tyber Zann, who seeks to take advantage of the chaos caused by the Galactic Civil War. The expansion also introduces new units, planets, heroes, and gameplay features for all three factions.
 
The game's story mode follows Zann's rise to power as he challenges the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire for control of the galaxy. The player can also choose to play as the Rebels or the Empire in a new galactic conquest mode that includes corruption mechanics, such as bribery, piracy, kidnapping, and sabotage. The game also supports multiplayer modes with up to eight players online.

The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its variety, balance, and replay value. However, some criticized its technical issues, voice acting, and lack of innovation. The game is considered by many fans to be one of the best Star Wars strategy games ever made.
 
The game is available for purchase on Steam[^2^] or other online platforms. It requires the base game Star Wars: Empire at War to play.

The game's gameplay is similar to the base game, but with some new additions and changes. The player can control land and space units in real-time battles, as well as manage the galactic map and economy. The Zann Consortium has some unique units and abilities that set it apart from the other factions. For example, the consortium can use cloaking devices, defilers (agents that can corrupt planets), and corruption abilities (such as bribing enemy units or stealing credits). The consortium also has access to some of the most iconic ships and characters from the Star Wars universe, such as the Slave I, the Eclipse Super Star Destroyer, and IG-88.
 
The game also features a skirmish mode that allows the player to customize and play land or space battles against the AI or other players online. The skirmish mode has a variety of maps and settings to choose from, as well as different victory conditions. The player can also use a map editor to create their own scenarios and share them with others. The game also supports mods that can add new content or change existing aspects of the game. Some of the most popular mods include Republic at War, Thrawn's Revenge, Awakening of the Rebellion, and Fall of the Republic.
 
Star Wars: Empire at War: Forces of Corruption is a must-play for any Star Wars fan who enjoys strategy games. It offers a fresh and fun perspective on the Galactic Civil War, as well as a lot of replay value and customization options. The game is not perfect, as it suffers from some bugs, glitches, and balance issues, but it is still a solid and enjoyable expansion that enhances the original game.
