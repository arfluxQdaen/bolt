Moreover, Adobe has also stopped providing access to the installers and serial numbers that allowed users to run CS3 without activation. These options were offered as a temporary solution when the activation servers were shut down in 2017. Unfortunately, there is nothing that Customer Care agents can do to assist with this issue. CS3 is officially obsolete and unusable.

If you are still using CS3 products, you may be wondering what your options are. The good news is that Adobe offers a variety of creative cloud plans that give you access to the latest versions of Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign and more. You can also enjoy the benefits of cloud storage, online collaboration and regular updates. You can choose a plan that suits your needs and budget, whether you are an individual, a student, a team or a business.
  
Alternatively, you may want to explore other software alternatives that are compatible with your current operating system and hardware. There are many free or low-cost options available online that can perform similar functions as CS3 products. Some examples are GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus and Affinity. However, you may need to learn new skills and workflows to use these programs effectively. You may also encounter some compatibility issues when working with files created in CS3.
  
Whatever you decide to do, it is important to back up your files and uninstall CS3 products from your computer as soon as possible. This will prevent any potential security risks or performance issues that may arise from using outdated software. You can also free up some disk space and memory for your new software. We hope that this information has been helpful and we apologize for any inconvenience caused by the discontinuation of CS3.
