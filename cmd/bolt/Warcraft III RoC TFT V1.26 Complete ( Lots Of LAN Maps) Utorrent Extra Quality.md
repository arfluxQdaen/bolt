I just updated from version 1.24 to 1.25b and now there is already version 1.26 available. This is faster than the release of AI maps. Why can't they combine all the changes into one comprehensive patch instead of releasing them separately? This is very annoying and time-consuming.

I have been playing Warcraft for a long time and I enjoy the game very much. But these constant updates are ruining my experience. I feel like I have to spend more time downloading and installing patches than actually playing the game. And sometimes the patches introduce new bugs or problems that make the game worse.
  
I understand that the developers want to improve the game and fix the issues, but they should do it in a more efficient and considerate way. They should test the patches thoroughly before releasing them and make sure they are compatible with all platforms and versions. They should also communicate with the players and inform them about the reasons and benefits of the updates.

I want to have fun with Warcraft, not frustration.
